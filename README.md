# Volunteer-Me

## Description

The purpose of this application is to provide a social based format to gather and support volunteer activities.


- What problem does it solve?

    -As a development team we wish to implement a way for individuals to organize and execute acts of service at the local level. We feel that this app has the potential to make this happen.

- Some key takeaways:

    - Consistency with naming conventions throughout branches and files is crucial to ensuring a smooth running application.

    -Google Map and places api is not as easy to implement as one may expect, would likely proceed using mapbox for future development.

    -Stripe's payment platform is vast and very functional. In the future we would like to add payment functionality for user donations in order to support the volunteer effort.
